Escape from The Underworld



A simple, modular text-based roguelite inspired by Greek mythology and Hades.
You play a demigod with a randomly assigned god parent (passive bonus + one-use god item).
Travel through Asphodel, Elysium, and Tartarus, face random events, solve an Oracle of Delphi puzzle for buffs, and reach one of multiple endings based on Health, Soul, and Alignment.
