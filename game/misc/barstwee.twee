:: Start [start]
Night City after dark. Neon bleeds through the rain and music spills into the streets.
You check your holo-map — three hotspots still alive tonight.

* [[1. Lizzie’s Bar — Mox neon, dancers, and braindance haze.->Lizzie’s Bar]]
* [[2. Afterlife — the mercs’ sanctuary, where legends never die.->Afterlife]]
* [[3. Totentanz — chaos, metal, Maelstrom territory.->Totentanz]]
* [[4. Leave — maybe another night.->Leave]]

:: Lizzie’s Bar
You push through Lizzie’s violet glow. Moxes laugh over the thump of bass,
dancers spin under pink holograms, and braindance rigs hum from upstairs.

What do you do?
* [[1. Get a drink->Lizzie’s: Drinks]]
* [[2. Dance->Lizzie’s: Dance]]
* [[3. Watch a BD->Lizzie’s: BD]]
* [[4. Leave->Street Exit]]

You lean on the bar. The bartender eyes you with a smirk.
“**What’ll it be, choom?**”

* [[Tequila Especial — smooth and fiery.->Lizzie’s: Tequila]]
* [[Chateau Delen 2012 — overpriced, imported, and barely real.->Lizzie’s: Wine]]
* [[Broseph Ale — cheap, bitter, and familiar.->Lizzie’s: Ale]]
* [[Never mind. Maybe later.->Lizzie’s: No Drink]]

:: Lizzie’s: Tequila
The tequila burns clean — sweet aftertaste, like synthetic lime and regret.

You sip the fake vintage wine. For a second, you almost believe the label.

* [[Back to the floor->Lizzie’s Bar]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

* [[Keep exploring Lizzie’s->Lizzie’s Bar]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

:: Lizzie’s: BD
Upstairs, a BD chair hums softly. You slot in for a short run — someone else’s memories, someone else’s night.

* [[Shake it off and return downstairs->Lizzie’s Bar]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

:: Afterlife
You step into the Afterlife — cold light, steel walls, and whispers of legends.
Mercs talk shop under holo-names of the fallen, and the air smells like old gun oil and money.

The Johnny burns your throat and memories alike.

* [[Back to the floor->Afterlife]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

:: Afterlife: Jackie
The Jackie is smooth and warm. Just like the proud son of Heywood himself was.

* [[Back to the floor->Afterlife]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

:: Afterlife: David
The David hits hard and fades fast — just like the man himself.

* [[Back to the floor->Afterlife]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

:: Afterlife: No Drink
You change your mind. Maybe just water.

* [[Back to the floor->Afterlife]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

:: Afterlife: Rogue
Rogue’s at her usual spot — sharp gaze, sharper words. She looks you up and down.\
**Rogue:** “You got biz, or you’re just another tourist?”\
You talk for a bit — small talk mixed with subtle threats. Classic Rogue.

* [[Return to the main room->Afterlife]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

:: Afterlife: Booth
You take a booth alone. Mercs talk shop nearby — contracts, chrome, death. Feels like history.

* [[Return to the bar floor->Afterlife]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

:: Totentanz
You descend into Totentanz — a fortress of noise and flashing red light.
The floor shakes from the bass, Maelstrom gangoons throwing themselves into each other like cybernetic storms.

What do you do?
* [[1. Get a drink->Totentanz: Drinks]]
* [[2. Crowdwatch (Maelstrom’s always up to something)->Totentanz: Crowdwatch]]

* [[Calavera Feliz — yeah, there’s two taps of it. Don’t ask.->Totentanz: Calavera]]
* [[Actually, I’ll pass.->Totentanz: No Drink]]

:: Totentanz: Stout
The stout is thick, metallic, and strong enough to knock a borg offline.

* [[Back to the floor->Totentanz]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

:: Totentanz: Calavera
The Calavera Feliz tastes like chemical summer and regret — classic Totentanz.

* [[Back to the floor->Totentanz]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

:: Totentanz: No Drink
You change your mind and step away before the bartender changes *your* mind.

* [[Back to the floor->Totentanz]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

:: Totentanz: Crowdwatch
You stay near the wall, watching Maelstrom run their chaos routine — new chrome on display, blood in the lights.

* [[Keep moving->Totentanz]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

:: Totentanz: Backroom
You slip into the backroom. A few edgerunners are arguing over shards and eddies — better not interrupt.

* [[Back to the main floor->Totentanz]]
* [[Head back out->Street Exit]]

:: Leave
You decide to skip the nightlife. Night City still hums, waiting for your next bad idea.

* [[Call it a night->Night Stretch]]

You step away from the neon and back into the city’s pulse.

* [[Check the map again->Start]]

:: Night Stretch
The night stretches on — another corner, another story waiting to happen.

* [[Back to the map->Start]]
