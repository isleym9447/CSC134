### Cyberpunk C++ Visual Novel — Final Project ###

A narrative-driven interactive game built in C++ using SFML.

# Project Overview 

This project is a Cyberpunk-themed visual novel / narrative RPG, written entirely in C++ and rendered using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
It is an expanded, modernized version of the earlier terminal-based CYOA game, now featuring:

A full visual UI rendered in an SFML window

Scene transitions

Player-choice branching

Character creation

A modular game architecture (separate scenes, managers, and state handling)

Expandable story content

The game follows a custom protagonist navigating Night City—making choices, interacting with NPCs, and progressing through a branching narrative built from multiple source files.

This README contains everything needed for the instructor to build, run, and evaluate the game on any Windows 10/11 machine.
