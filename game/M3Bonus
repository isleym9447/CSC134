What surprised you about working with AI?
-Im used to it by now, but it never fails to surpise me at just how intelligent its becoming everyday.
What was harder than expected? (AI canâ€™t read your mind!)
-Communicating what I want from my mind into words. I know what I want the program to do, but translating it into asking it to make the code, is what trips me up.
What was easier than expected?
-I grasped c++ way faster than other languages for some reason. So understanding what the ai is telling me is a breeze. If I dont understand I ask it to clarify.
Would you use AI differently now? How?
-I want to make my own chatbots so badly! I want to personalize my outputs
What concepts clicked for you during this project?
-I have experience with CYOA games so translating it into c++ was so fun. I loved using the knowledge of higher level c++ techniques to make the game how I want
