 BARS.CPP ‚Äî FUTURE EXPANSION IDEAS & SYSTEM INTEGRATIONS
=========================================================

[üîπ SYSTEM HOOK IDEAS]

‚Ä¢ STREET CRED REQUIREMENTS:
    - Require streetcred >= 10 to enter Afterlife.
    - Totentanz might require streetcred >= 5 (or a Maelstrom encounter first).
    - Lizzie‚Äôs always open (neutral territory).

‚Ä¢ CORPO INFLUENCE EFFECTS:
    - If (corpoinfluence == true):
        - Some bars (Totentanz) react with hostility.
        - Afterlife patrons distrust corpo types.
        - Rogue might have unique dialogue: ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see a suit down here.‚Äù
        - At Lizzie‚Äôs, Moxes might flirt but not trust you.

‚Ä¢ DRINK EFFECTS:
    - Temporary stat modifiers (body, reflex, tech, cool) for next encounter.
    - Chance for mild hangover / blurred vision flavor next morning.
    - Possible dialogue changes if intoxicated.

‚Ä¢ REPUTATION FLAGS:
    - Visiting each bar for the first time could increment unique counters.
      e.g.  visited_lizzies = true, visited_afterlife = true, visited_totentanz = true
    - Later used for dialogue or gig unlocks:
        ‚ÄúHeard you‚Äôve been around Night City‚Äôs hotspots.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ EVENT HOOKS:
    - LIZZIE‚ÄôS:
        - Judy or a Mox could offer a quick gig.
        - Braindance could trigger a hidden lore flashback.
    - AFTERLIFE:
        - Talking to Rogue sets a flag ‚Üí ‚ÄúmetRogue = true‚Äù
          (unlocks fixer-style gig or special dialogue later).
        - Sitting at a booth could trigger overheard merc chatter ‚Üí gig lead.
    - TOTENTANZ:
        - Maelstrom crowdwatch could trigger random combat event.
        - ‚ÄúSlip into backroom‚Äù may lead to illegal BD or side job offer.

‚Ä¢ TIME-BASED VARIATION:
    - Different bar dialogue if it‚Äôs ‚Äúnight‚Äù, ‚Äúlate night‚Äù, or ‚Äúearly morning‚Äù.
    - Add cooldowns: can‚Äôt revisit same bar twice in a row.

‚Ä¢ ROMANCE & SOCIAL REACTIONS:
    - High Cool stat: special bar dialogue options.
    - Corpo or Streetkid origin could alter bartenders‚Äô responses.
    - Potential flirt scenes at Lizzie‚Äôs (Mox dancers, patrons, etc.).

‚Ä¢ AUDIO / VISUAL FLAVOR:
    - ASCII ambient sound cues or HUD color changes per bar.
        Lizzie‚Äôs = pink/purple neon
        Afterlife = blue/silver cold tone
        Totentanz = red/strobe warning

‚Ä¢ FUTURE SYSTEM INTEGRATIONS:
    - Drinking too much might lower stealth accuracy temporarily.
    - Setting rogueFlag = true could allow new fixer call options later.
    - Expanding bars() into a hub loop with sub-functions (lizzies(), afterlife(), totentanz()) for cleaner modularity.
