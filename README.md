# Hey Chooms! #

## ⚡ C++ SYSTEMS: BY Tea  ##
> *"In Night City, legacy isn't bought. It's compiled."*

Welcome to my **C++ Operations Archive** — a collection of builds, tests, experiments, and executable chaos forged through CSC 134 and beyond.  
Whether you're browsing code from my early training or peeking at more advanced systems, this repo is where every line counts.

## 🧠 CURRENT MODULE: CSC 134 – C++ Programming  
📍 **Status:** Active  
📍 **Location:** Classroom → Terminal → Network  
📍 **Gear:** Visual Studio / VS Code / CLI  
📍 **Term:** Fall 2025

## 🧩 CONTENTS

🟣 `assignments/`  
→ Projects from CSC 134 coursework. Core mechanics. Foundational syntax. Early builds.

🟡 `labs/`  
→ Experiments, practice problems, sandbox logic. Where I break things on purpose to learn.

🔵 `projects/`  
→ Larger builds & creative code work. May contain chrome.

🟠 `utils/`  
→ Reusable code, snippets, and modular functions I may plug into future builds.

## 🚧 MISSION STATEMENT

This isn’t just for grades.  
This repo is my **core**, my **loadout**, and my **proof of progression**.  
It’s where logic meets aesthetics, and bugs get flatlined.  
Over time, you’ll see the evolution—from basic syntax to something with real backbone.

> 🗂️ “Start with code. End with control.”

## 🛠️ FUTURE PLANS

- [ ] Expand `projects/` with personal builds outside of coursework  
- [ ] Refactor older labs with cleaner modular design  
- [ ] Integrate README files for individual subfolders  
- [ ] Eventually: Build a full-stack project using C++ backend logic
