********* Cyberpunk CYOA — Complete Story & Systems Map *********


Global Systems: (active after scene1())

- Always-on HUD: show HEALTH and STREET CRED at top of each screen/step.

- 0 = Check Stats (available in every menu after scene1()):

- 9 = Quit Game from any menu after scene1() (clean exit).

- Inventory (items, cyberware shards, tattoos)

    Street Cred

    Eddies

    Health

    Vehicle (Nomad only; otherwise “None”)

    Romance (only shows unlocked romances; e.g., shows Juno = 2 if you’ve flirted with Juno; does not list others at 0)


- Romance System

    Juno: romance rises via phone [Flirt] choices (unlocked on 2nd call).

    Rafe: romance rises via phone [Flirt] choices (unlocked on 2nd call).

    Viktor: romance rises via clinic visits (not calls). At 5th visit, a scapegoat fork appears:

    All three romance tracks can progress in the same playthrough.

            2nd: “Still the same face staring back.”

            3rd+: “…nothing’s changed since you checked last time.”

        2 Check inventory

            1st: “Basic kit, nothing fancy.”

scene2()
 — The Fixer Call
        Fixer offers a job: Recover data from a warehouse.

        Accept → travel choices → scene3()

        Deny → (TBD: currently returns/loops; you can later route to free-roam/downtime if desired)



    Travel Options
        -Metro (free; flavor)

        -Delamain (Eddies –cost, 200)

        -Walk (flavor; possible later risk/event hook)

        -Drive (Nomad only)

            If not Nomad: “You don’t own a car, choom.” → return to travel menu

    → Arrive at warehouse → scene3()


***************************************************************

scene3()
 — Warehouse Job


Exterior: neon cams, patrolling guards, locked doors.



    Approach:

        Guns blazing

            Streetkid only (has pistol): combat → HEALTH –, STREET CRED ++

            “You’re bleeding, but people talk when you’re bold.”

            Corpo/Nomad: “You don’t have a weapon for this. Stealth it is.” → redirect to Stealth

        Stealth

            “The shadows swallow you as you circle the warehouse.”

            Stealth Sub-choices (all succeed; different flavor):

            Hack the cameras (future mini-game hook)

            Distract guards (toss can)

            Crawl through vents



    Shard Acquisition

        “Blue glow, humming with encrypted code.”



    Delivery to Fixer

        Pays out; you hand off the shard.

        Pop-ups:

            Combat path:

                >> EDDIES: +500
                >> STREET CRED: +2
                >> DATA SHARD: removed from inventory
                >> HEALTH: updated




            Stealth path (smaller cred, minimal/no damage):


                >> EDDIES: +500
                >> STREET CRED: +1
                >> DATA SHARD: removed from inventory



    “Might want to see a ripper” line if health low.

→ scene4()


***************************************************************


scene4()
 — Post-Job Sandbox


Narration: the city hums; night is young.



    Menu (loops until you choose a path that transitions):

        Visit a Ripperdoc

            Viktor Vektor (discount installs; warm gruff vibe)

            Kaia Gregory (OC) (full price; clinical, efficient)

        At either ripper:

        Check-up → HEALTH restored, cyberware list recap (life-path flavor)

        Install Kiroshi Optics

        Viktor (discount):


            >> CYBERWARE: Kiroshi Optics [Model V2] installed
            >> EDDIES: -300


        Kaia (full price):

            >> CYBERWARE: Kiroshi Optics [Model V2] installed
            >> EDDIES: -500


        If insufficient funds: “Come back when you’ve got the cash, choom.”

Leave clinic → immediate Fixer call checks optics:

    If Kiroshi installed → offered Kiroshi Gig → kiroshigig()

    If no Kiroshi → offered Non-Kiroshi Gig → nonkiroshigig()

        Viktor — Secret Romance specifics

        Track visitsToVik.

        On visit #5:

        Viktor: “…startin’ to think you like comin’ here for more than cyberware installation.”

        Player fork:

        [Flirt] “Is it that obvious, doc?” → unlock Viktor romance; adds future [Flirt]/[Confide] options in clinic/phone; romance points start accumulating.

        “No… I just have cheap cyberware.” → keep things platonic; romance does not start.

        Later (romance threshold, e.g., ≥7): unlock [Hug Viktor] during clinic visits (special scene; slow-burn intimacy).

    Go to a Bar (flavor/world-building; no stats)

        Lizzie’s (Mox neon, dancers, vibe)

        Totentanz (loud, chaotic, gang energy)

        Afterlife (merc legends’ haunt; Rogue sighting)

    Get a Tattoo (cosmetic side quest)

        Choose: Flower / Lion / Butterfly / Heart

        >> Tattoo [Lion] added to character profile


    Loops back to scene4() menu.

    Return to Apartment (available from many hubs; see Apartment/Day Off flow below)
